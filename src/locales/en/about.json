  "missionTitle": "The mission",
  "missionP1": "Doctors are surrounded by people all day — patients, nurses, colleagues — yet many describe a deep sense of social isolation outside the hospital. Long hours, rotating schedules, and frequent relocations make it nearly impossible to maintain friendships the way others do.",

  "expP2": "On the weekend, you meet. Maybe it's brunch at a neighbourhood spot. Maybe it's a walk along the canal. Maybe it's coffee at a quiet café. The format is simple. The connection is real.",
  "expP3": "No networking agendas. No forced icebreakers. Just a warm table and good company.",

  "storyP1": "The idea for BeyondRounds was born during one of those late-night hospital shifts that every doctor knows all too well. After years of moving between hospitals and diving deep into the demanding world of medicine, I found myself surrounded by colleagues — yet genuinely lonely.",
  "storyP2": "I've always been social. But something was missing. Conversations always circled back to cases, protocols, and research. Professionally enriching, sure — but I craved something deeper:",
  "storyP2Bold": "real friendships that went beyond the hospital walls.",
  "storyP3": "Everything changed when a mutual friend introduced me to four other doctors. We discovered we shared a passion for hiking, similar music tastes, and a quirky sense of humor that only made sense to fellow physicians.",
  "storyP4": "That's when it hit me:",
  "storyP4Bold": "if I felt this isolated despite working alongside brilliant medical minds, how many other doctors were experiencing the same thing?",
  "storyP5": "BeyondRounds was born from this realization — because when you find your tribe, everything else falls into place.",
