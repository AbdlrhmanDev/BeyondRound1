  "faqTitle": "Frequently asked questions",
  "faq1Q": "Who is BeyondRounds for?",
  "faq1A": "BeyondRounds is exclusively for licensed physicians in Berlin. Whether you're a resident, attending, or in private practice — if you hold a medical license and want genuine friendships outside the hospital, this is for you.",
  "faq2Q": "How are groups matched?",
  "faq2A": "We match based on city, shared interests, and weekend availability. Groups are intentionally small (3–4 doctors) so every conversation feels personal, not crowded.",
  "faq3Q": "What happens after I choose Friday/Sat/Sun?",
  "faq3A": "You'll enter a short registration flow to confirm your details and preferences. Once confirmed, you'll receive your group match and meetup details before the weekend.",
  "faq4Q": "What if someone no-shows?",
  "faq4A": "We take commitment seriously. Founding members receive a free re-match if their first meetup is affected by a no-show. We also send reminders and confirmations to minimize this.",
  "faq5Q": "Is this dating or networking?",
  "faq5A": "Neither. BeyondRounds is designed purely for friendship. No romantic matching, no business-card exchanges. Just real, relaxed social connection between doctors who want a life outside medicine.",
  "faq6Q": "How is verification done?",
  "faq6A": "During registration, we verify your medical credentials to ensure every member is a licensed physician. This keeps the community trusted and the conversations authentic.",
  "faq7Q": "Which cities are supported?",
  "faq7A": "We're launching in Berlin first. Additional cities will open based on demand — founding members get early access when new locations go live.",
